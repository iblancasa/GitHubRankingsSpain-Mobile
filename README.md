# GitHubRankings Spain - Mobile

**IMPORTANT**: this is a work in progress application done by a newbie in
[Flutter](https://flutter.io/). I am learning so... help me to learn!

## What is this repository?

This repository shows, in a nice way, the information from the repository
[GitHub Rankings Spain](ttps://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubRankingsSpain).
This repository contains a set of rankings generated by city and region.

**What kind of rankings?**: It sorts GitHub users by the number of **public
contributions** and groups them by the location in their profile. You can learn
more about the rankings in these repositories:

* [GitHubCity](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubCity): library to generate your own rankings
* [GitHub Spanish Ranking Generator](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubSpanishRankingGenerator): build system of the Spanish rankings
* [GitHub Rankings Spain](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubRankingsSpain): GitHub Spanish ranking dataset
